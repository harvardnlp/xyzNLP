	xyzNLP aims to build NLP systems that are safe, fast, and controllable. They are interested primarily in tasks that involve text generation such as machine translation, document summarization, and data-to-text generation. Methodologically, they study data-driven probabilistic methods that combine deep-learning based models with probabilistic controls.
